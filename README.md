This application uses Firebase to store PDFs and data for signatures. You can use any other backend of your choice. 
However, to get started with this sample, please register a new app with [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).

After you have registered an app, create `.env` file in the root of the directory and place the following:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=your_key_goes_here
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_key_goes_here
REACT_APP_APP_ID=your_key_goes_here
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain_goes_here
REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=your_database_go_here
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
REACT_APP_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
```
The above information can be found under settings of your Firebase app.
